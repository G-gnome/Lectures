Notes for the _first_ slide!

# Agenda

1. Attendance

2. Homework

---




# Go to github and open issue for attendance




---


# Homework question one

* What is a promoter? What are the conserved elements of the bacterial promoter? What parts of
RNA polymerase interact with the promoter and how?


---


.center[Homework question one]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/transcription_start.png)]

* Promoter: binding site for RNA polymerase
* -35 Region: A sequence (TTGACA) located about 35 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. 
* -10 Region (Pribnow Box): Sequence is located about 10 base pairs upstream.

---

.center[Homework question one]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/RNA_pol.png)]


* Sigma factor recognizes and binds to -10 and -35 regions 
* The holoenzyme melts the DNA, creating ssDNA template
* Transcription initiated, sigma factor dissociates

---


# Homework question two

* Contrast Rho-dependent and Rho-independent transcriptional termination

---
.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/Rho_dependent_independent.jpeg)]

* Rho Factor: ATP-dependent helicase.

* Rho uses ATP to travel along the RNA transcript from 5' to 3', catching up with the moving RNA polymerase.

* Rho recognizes and binds termination sequence in the RNA transcript. It causes the transcription complex to dissociate.
---
.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/Rho_dependent_independent.jpeg)]

* Rho independent: stem loop forms, after which AUAU DNA-RNA hybrid with weak binding forms


* Dissociation

---

# Homework question three

* Distinguish between generalized and specialized transduction.


---


.center[Homework question three]

---

# Homework question four

* What is the Shine-Dalgarno sequence? What does it interact with?


---


.center[Homework question four]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/shine_delgarno.png)]

* Shine delgarno sequence: ribosomal binding sequence on RNA
* The 16S RNA binds to it using the anti-delgarno sequence

---

# Homework question five

* What is the Ames Test and how does it work?

---


.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/Ames_test.png)]

* His - Samlonella strains plated on His - plates along with mutagen
* Number of revertants (those that revert to normal His synthesis) proportional to mutagen power

---


# Homework question six

* Describe what silent, nonsense, frameshift, missense mutations are, and how they relate to the
genetic code for protein production


---


.center[Homework question six]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/mutations.png)]

---


# Homework question seven

* What are transposons?


---


.center[Homework question seven]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/transposase.png)]
* Mobile genetic elements
* Can encode the transposase enzyme
* Use transposases to recognize either end (LTR) and cut
* They are then inserted to the target site

---


# Homework question eight

* How do bacteria repair double-strand DNA breaks? Describe the SOS response and how RecA
and LexA combine to regulate this repair process.

---


.center[Homework question eight]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/recatwo.png)]
* dsDNA breaks
* RecA activates when it recognizes broken ssDNA
* Degrades lexA repressor, SOS response genes transcribed
* RecA binds ssDNA, facilitates strand repair

---


# Homework

* Final presentation topic and approval - Your TA reserves the right to assign you a topic if your groupâ€™s chosen topic does not meet their approval

* TA will check that students have brought their 3 acceptable references for their presentation next week

* Must present on bacterial or viral pathogen
