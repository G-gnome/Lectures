Notes for the _first_ slide!

---

# Agenda

1. Attendance

2. Checking sources and topic

2. Homework

---




# Go to github and open issue for attendance




---




# Submit a github issue with your three sources per group and your topic for presentation (a microbe that causes disease)




---

# Homework question one

* List the steps involved in performing the Gram stain. Explain why some cells turn blue and some cells turn pink/red.


---


.center[Homework question one]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/Gram.png)]

* Crystal violet stains peptidoglycan
* Gram positive bacteria are purple because they have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall which retains the crystal violet
* Safranin can also stain gram +, but the crystal violet is stronger so you don't notice

---


# Homework question two

* Compare and contrast a typical Gram-negative bacterium versus a typical Gram-positive
bacterium with respect to cell wall structure and morphology. Explain the appearance of these
two classes of bacteria after Gram staining.


---
.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/structure.png)]

* NAG: Binds to peptide chain
* Peptide chain forms bond to other peptidoglycan units
* NAG can bind to the peptide chain due to the lack of an extra functional group
* NAM has an acidic functional group which inhibits it's ability to bind the peptide chain

---

* NAG: Binds to peptide chain

* NAG forms peptide bonds

---

.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/interbridge.png)]

* Gram + forms glycine interbridge and has thicker cell wall

* Glycine is the smallest amino acid, allows for flexability but also forms strong peptide bonds

* Gram negative bind directly between amino acid chains

* Notice that gram positive and negative AA chain bonds are different


---

.center[Homework question two]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/posneg.png)]

* Gram negative bacteria have thinner peptidoglycan which allows them to more easily interact with a host and makes them more flexible

* Gram negative bacteria also have OM and LPS that serves as a protective barrier and participates in immune evasion and antibiotic resistance

* Murein lipoproteins (Braun’s lipoproteins): link to the peptidoglycan in gram negative bacteria to anchor to membrane


---

# Homework question three

* Why is the rigid layer of the bacterial cell wall called peptidoglycan? What are the chemical
reasons for the rigidity of this structure?


---


.center[Homework question three]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/interbridge.png)]

* Peptid = peptides
* Glycan = Sugar backbone
* Strong due to cross linked mesh structure (strands antiparralel/parallel, contributes to stability)
* Covalent peptide bonds are Strong
* Combo of rigid and non rigid AA side chains (eg DAP has two amino groups, contributes to stability)

---

# Homework question four

* Describe the differences between primary and secondary active transport. Compare and
contrast PEP group translocation/PTS and ABC transporters. What are symporters and what are
antiporters?

---

.center[Homework question four]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/transport.png)]

* If flow of substance is unfavorable (against concentration gradient) energy is required (active transport)

* Couple energetically favourable and unfavorable reactions/movement to accomplish this

* Primary: uses energy from ATP hydrolisis or other phosphate  hydrolysis (eg PEP)

* Secondary: Uses chemical gradient only

---

.center[Homework question four]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/ABC.png)]

* ABC = ATP-Binding Cassette
* Solute-binding protein (SBP) and ATP-hydrolyzing protein 

---

.center[Homework question four]

.center[![Microbiology Image](images/PTS.png)]

* Phosphotransferase system (PTS) uses facilitated diffusion to let glucose enter the cell, but modifies it so it can't leave using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) – phosphate donor

* There is actually a phosphate transfer cascade not shown in this diagram

* Addition of phosphate means that the chemical glucose is now a different chemical, so the concentration gradient does not change (high glucose outside, but low glucose and high glucose-PO4 inside)

---

# Homework

* Nothing
